You don't want PLATITUDES?

You want a LATITUDE?

Well, ok I have one of those too.

GOOD LUCK!

A: Harmony Pilates* ... where you're more than just a number, unless it’s MBO

B: The number of hours per day that the Anytime Fitness in Fairmount is open plus the number of hours per day that all of the Anytime Fitnesses in Ann Arbor are open minus the number of hours per day that the Anytime Fitness nearest to Xiang’s home is open minus 24

C: 407,201 Club OS users were born in this year.

D: The most common birth year among Club OS users.

E: The very first Club OS user has this number in their username.

F: The percentage of Club OS users at Anytime Fitness that are female.

G: The percentage of Club OS users at Orange Theory that are female.

H: On December 5th, 2013, Aaron sent Loria an email. He wanted to know what she ate over the past how many days?

The latitude (L) is = [A,(D%(E+1)),B*H,CEILING((C-G)/F)*H]

Text me ""+L if you figure out an answer, and I'll letcha know if it rings a bell.

*Oh, there are 4 of them?  Rly? I mean the one with the {{B}} hour cancellation policy for appointments and {{B}}*2 hour cancellation policy for group classes.
